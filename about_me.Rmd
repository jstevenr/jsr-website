### Introduction

My name is J Steven Raquel. I'm an undergraduate at the University of California, Santa Barbara pursuing a degree in Statistical Science with a concentration in Applied Statistics, set to graduate in spring 2018. 

<br>

### Work Experience

I have been employed since Sept 2016 as a data intern at the [National Center of Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) (NCEAS), as a member of a team dedicated to curating the data that comes into the [Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io/), and maintaining the dataset's metadata. 

<br>

### Expertise

My primary programming language is `R`, with which I have experience cleaning, visualizing, and analyzing data. In my job at NCEAS, I work with a markup language called `EML` or Ecological Metadata Language, a variant of `XML` and a widely used metadata standard for ecological data. 

<br>

I'm currently learning how to code in `SQL` to work with databases. 

<br>

### Hobbies

In my free time, I am an avid gamer. I also have a weekly college radio show called *The Company of Lazarus* on [91.9 KCSB-FM](kcsb.org).
