# Introduction

My name is J Steven Raquel. I am an undergraduate at the University of California, Santa Barbara, studying statistics with the ultimate goal of becoming a data scientist.  

I have been employed since September 2016 at the [National Center of Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) (NCEAS), as a member of a team dedicated to curating the data and metadata that comes into the [Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io/), a repository designed to host ecological data and funded by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/) (NSF).

If I am not learning a new programming skill in my free time (currently focused on learning SQL), then I am probably playing video games or listening to music, especially for the purpose of finding music for the radio show I have on 91.9 KCSB-FM, titled "The Company of Lazarus".
