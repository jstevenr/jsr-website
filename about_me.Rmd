# Introduction

My name is J Steven Raquel. I am an undergraduate at the University of California, Santa Barbara, studying statistics with the ultimate goal of becoming a data scientist. I am currently employed as the Production Coordinator at UCSB's radio station, 91.9 KCSB-FM. 

If I am not learning a new programming skill in my free time (currently focused on learning both Python and SQL), then I am most likely looking for music for my radio show, The Company of Lazarus. In my free time I am an avid gamer and a scholar of both Spanish and Portuguese. I aspire to travel across both Europe and Latin America someday.
