# Welcome!

Thanks for visiting my personal website. I'm J Steven Raquel, a statistics undergrad at UC Santa Barbara, set to graduate in spring of 2018. I have been programming in R for about 2 years now and am steadily learning new skills in both R and in other languages like Python and SQL. 

Find out more about [who I am and what I've done](about_me.html).

If you know anything about data science, statistics, machine learning, AI, or computer science, feel free to get in touch with me. I have a lot to learn so I'm eager to touch base with folks with similar interests.

## Projects  

These are some of the projects I've worked on throughout my time studying data science, and I am constantly learning and adding things to my repertoire.

### Machine Learning

* #### [Classifying wine quality](wine-classification.html)

For my final project for PSTAT 131 Data Mining, I used and compared the decision tree, randomForest and k-Nearest Neighbors algorithms to determine the quality of a wine and what the best algorithm was for classification. I also came to determine what attributes were most important towards a good wine.

### Data Visualization

* #### [Visualizing IMDB ratings](imdb.html)

I looked at the past several decades in film as far back as the 1980s, and visualized each one to see what was the best audience-reviewed decade and what the best films were.
