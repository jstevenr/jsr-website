## Welcome!

Thanks for visiting my personal website. I am a statistics undergrad at UC Santa Barbara, set to graduate in spring of 2018. Find out more about [who I am](https://jstevenr.github.io/about_me.html) and [what I've done](https://jstevenr.github.io/portfolio.html). 

### Let's Talk!

If you know anything about data science, statistics, machine learning, AI, or computer science, *get in touch with me*! I have a lot to learn so I'm eager to get in touch with folks with similar interests.
